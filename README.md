# libPDEFI
A public domain C library for working with EFI firmwares.

# Goals
Our goal is to save EFI developer's time by implementing some useful functions in a static library.

# Status
The library is in active development.

# Roadmap
- Disk I/O - x86 ATA PIO, need help with EFI interfaces.

# Compilation instructions
Just 'make' it.
You'll need x86_64-w64-mingw32 toolchain.
